- ### GCD
    ---
    ###### copy line below and click single arrow in the top left of the screen
        
            Abstract.GCD(17,19) 
        
    ###### should return 
        
            1
    ---

- ### gcdSteps
    ---
    ###### copy line below and click single arrow in the top left of the screen
        
            Abstract.gcdSteps(3,2)
        
    ###### Should return steps of the problem using Euclid's alogirthm

        
            (['3 = 2*1 + 1', '2 = 1*2 + 0'], ['1 = 3 - 2*1'])

- ### simplifyCongruence
    - Example  
        - You want to simplify 176y ≡ 57x (mod 14)

        ###### We can simplify this by typing out the following
        by copying the line below and clicking single arrow in the top left of the screen
       
        ---
            Abstract.simplifyCongruence(176,57,14)
        ---
        
       ###### This should return 
        ---
            8 ≡ 1 (mod 14)
        ---

        ###### This basically means that 
        ---
            8y ≡ x (mod 14)
        ---
